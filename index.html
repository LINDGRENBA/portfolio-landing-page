            <h3 class="section-header">About Me:</h3>
            <p>I am a firm believer that anyone can accomplish anything if they work hard enough and are given the right resources and support. In spite of a rough introduction to science and technology in high school, I have learned to work hard at understanding each of these subjects and now have a deep, nerdy love for them. I enjoy listening to podcasts and books on tape while cooking, baking or walking my dog. I combine my love of learning and podcasts by listening to 'Time Suck' <em>(NSFW!)</em>, an informational podcast that explores a vast range of subjects. Although the average human body is made up of more than 50% water, I'm pretty sure for me it's coffee. <strong>Sweet</strong>, sweet coffee...</p>

          <p>I am addicted to learning. I obtained my Associate of Arts Degree by the time I graduated high school, and that was only the beginning. After that I went on to study several languages and graduated from Western Washington University with my Bachelors in Japanese. After teaching in Japan, I completed and intensive program in New York, NY. and received SIT TESOL certification. Three years later I returned to school to get an Associate of Science degree and a license to practice dental hygiene. Now, I'm enrolled at Epicodus, a programming bootcamp in Portland, OR. I began learning to code at first as a hobby, a way to unwind after work as well as a way to bring creativity back into my life. When I was still coding several years later, I decided to make it my career. I'm grateful that because I have worn many hats, I bring a lot of different skills to the table!</p>
